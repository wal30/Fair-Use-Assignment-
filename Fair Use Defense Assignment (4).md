## **Fair and Square** 
#### _By: Wendy Liroff_ 

#### Question: What makes fair use fair?  
With the extent of today's media sources, the argument for where fair use is successful and not successful can get very controversial. There is an unclear line of where an interpretation of a media form turns from original to infringing on the copyright. On a site like youtube, copyright and fair use are two things that battle constantly. But there are four factors to keep in mind in order to determine whether or not the content is fair use. These four factors are:  

1. _The purpose and character of your use_  
2. _The nature of the copyrighted work_  
3. _The amount and substantiality of the portion taken, and_  
4. _The effect of the use upon the potential market_  

These four factors are not all that goes into deciding whether or not something is fair use, but they are the main four factors in order to produce a solid deffence in a case of fair use or copyright infringment 

#### Can I have an example please?    
In order to better understand fair use, an example comes in handy. Most millenials have heard of or seen the nickelodeon show _Spongebob Squarepants_, yes? Well, there is a prime example of fair use that takes place as a remix, on youtube, of the infamous song,  
[Krusty Krab Pizza.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww_t769yztI)

When it comes to remixes on youtube of known songs, television shows, movies, etc., there is always a question of whether the content is fair use or not. In order for Nickelodeon to protect its characters, ideas, shows, etc., they have in place copious amounts of copyright laws. This can make it very difficult for someone to make a remix like the one I have posted above. But in this case, it is comlpetely fair use. The table below explains why:

| Fair Use Factors | Explination | 
| -----------------| ----------- |
| 1. The factor and character of your use | This remix was not created in order to make a profit. The content was made to share as a hobby rather than to elicit money. |
| 2. The nature of the copyrighted work | The content is a remix of a popular song from the television show Spongebob Squarepants but it is changed enough so that a new sound is developed |
| 3. The amount and substantiallity of the portion taken | There is only a small portion of the original "Krusty Krab Pizza" song used to make the remix. The majority of the song is not a part of this remix and the part that is used, is changed to, again, create a new sound |
| 4. The effect of the use upon the potential market | There is no profit being made by this remix thus there is no profit taken away from Nickleodeon and the television show. The creator used both youtube and Soundcloud to share his interpretation of "Krusty Krab Pizza". With both of these sharing spaces, the creator is not able to gain a profit from his/her work |  
The main reason for the content of this remix not infringing on the copyright that Nickelodeon owns, is because there is no intention of gaining a profit from the work created. Although the creater of the remix has tens of thousands of views on youtube, their intention of creating the remix was not for the purpose of earning money. They were doing it to express their creative thoughts and decided to use Krusty Krab Pizza to do it.  
Because of the reasons listed above, this particular remix is a prime example of being completely fair use.
